# This script is run by .procmailrc.
# It's purpose is to redirect any error email received from the mapper, sandbox, 
# or root crontab scripts to become a GitHub alert issue.
# To configure, create a .procmailrc file in the home directory of the user account
# receiving the problem emails. It should only contain these 4 lines:
#:0
#{
#    INCLUDERC="$HOME/labeller/common/procmail_crontab_issue_rc"
#}

# And create a .forward file in the same home directory with this 1 line:
#"|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75 #user"

# Remove the leading '#' characters, and copy the 5 lines exactly as is.
